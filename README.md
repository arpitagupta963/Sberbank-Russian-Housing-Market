# Sberbank-Russian-Housing-Market
In May 2017, Sberbank, Russiaâ€™s oldest and largest bank, challenged data scientists on Kaggle to develop algorithms which use a broad spectrum of features to predict real prices. Algorithm applications rely on a rich dataset that includes housing data and macroeconomic patterns. An accurate forecasting model will allow Sberbank to provide more certainty to their customers in an uncertain economy.


This repository contains 6 files 4 ipython notebook and 2 pickle file:
EDA_sberbank.ipynb : This file has the complete data analysis part
Feature_engg.ipynb : In this file i have done data cleaning and processing and have tried variou models and observe the permofance of each model.
Model.ipynb : This file only have my custom model 
Final.ipynb : This file is using the result of the best model and doing the predictions. You only have to pass the data and you will get the prediction.
The other two files are the pickle file, they are generating from the Model.ipynb file and we are using these files in Final.ipynb file to make the prdictions.
